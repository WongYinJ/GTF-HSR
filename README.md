# GTF-HSR

Implementation of the algorithm proposed in the paper {Y. Wang, W. Li, Y. Gui, Q. Du and J. E. Fowler, "A Generalized Tensor Formulation for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution Under General Spatial Blurring," in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, doi: 10.1109/TPAMI.2025.3545605.}

Two demos are provided in the project. demo_UrbanGau.m applies the algorithm to HSR problem subject to Gaussian blurring; demo_UrbanAniGau.m applies the algorithm to HSR problem subject to Anisotropic Gaussian blurring;

Remember to decompress the tensor_toolbox_2.5.zip file in the path ..\Tools\ and URBAN.zip for the data before usage.
